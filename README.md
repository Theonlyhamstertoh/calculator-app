## Project Information ##
This calculator was completed within 5 days between February 15 - 19 to hold myself accountable to a deadline. The project is a part of the Odin Project.  

## Skills Learned ##
* How to manipulate a array and string with array.filter(), array.map(), array.reduce(), include(), etc.
* Accessibility for mobile users
* button animations 
* improved in CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox
* Improved in box shadow effects to create physical button looks

## Lessons Learned ##
This project was definitely a tough one at the current knowledge I have. 
* I learned that repeating to myself "I know I can do it" and "There is a better way" allow me to keep hopes that I was capable of doing this. 
* I learned how important a good mindset it is to have when facing challenges. We are as big as our thoughts. If I had subjected to myself to false belief that I wasn't able to do this project, I would of believed it. But I can and to whoever reads this, if you are a beginner like I am or a professional, keep at it. 
* I learned the system to solving a complex project (creating this calculator) by breaking it down and focusing on the small little problems and focus on solving one at a time to avoid stress. I wrote down my thoughts on hand and brainstorm on paper. 
* I learned the importance of good old humor and not taking myself seriously. I believe it's better to laugh at oneself for the bugs or problems made then to criticize. Better to laugh and be in the right mood then to be in a negative mood unable to avoid the thoughts of self-hate. 
* I learned to struggle. The more I struggle, I knew the more I grew. And I am really proud of the feat of accomplishing this project from the beginner point of view standpoint. 


## To You Who Is Reading This ##
If you are a beginner as I am, put focus on the long-term growth instead of the short-term struggle. I am struggling, you are struggling. You and I will feel that we are not growing. It feels stagant and slow. It feels impossible to ever become a professional programmer. **But tell yourself you can. The more you struggle in the short-term when the progress is barely noticeable will eventually allow you to grow at a exponential rate in the future**. Keep the long-term potential you have in your mind. Imagine the light at the end of tunnel even if there may be none. Because there is light. And you have to see through it.
